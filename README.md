# LP_MP-QAP
Dual decomposition solvers for the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), also called graph matching in computer vision based on the [LP_MP](https://github.com/pawelswoboda/LP_MP) library.

## Solvers
* Minimum cost flow based solver [1].
* Pure message passing based solver [1].
* SRMP with the QAP reformulated as a graphical model [2].
* Hungarian belief propagation [3].
